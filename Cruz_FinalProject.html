            <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Francis</span> Cruz</h1>
            <h3>First Year Cybersecurity Student</h3>
            <p>I'm a freshman studying at FEU Institute of Technology, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information
                Technology specialized in Cybersecurity. I am happy and strongly competitive when playing games, pushing
                my luck, and making a chance to discover my own dream. As technology evolves and the world keeps
                connected. I always hope the force around me stays connected, just like technologies can be very useful,
                also harmful which contains negative effects of using it. The force around me drives me to be a part of
                a computer course and also pushes me to seize the opportunity to transform into a better version of
                myself.</p>

                <h4>FRANCIS "KIKO" TYRONE F. CRUZ</h4>
                <p>Some of my classmates did not know who I was at first, but now everybody calls me "Kiko", a name my
                    mother given to me. My name is "Kiko" and I am 19 years old and a resident of Binangonan, Rizal. I
                    play games for fun and to relieve stress, whether I am playing gacha games where every pull is a
                    gamble or in MOBA games where I fight. Games by Riot Games make me want to play new games and get
                    inspired to play more games.

                    Apart from gaming, I spend a lot of my time on the basketball court or lost in the worlds of anime
                    fantasy. I do not like mathematics or any other problem solving activities, I rather love games, and
                    the thrill that comes with it. I may look quiet at first glance but once you interact with me, you
                    will find that I am cheerful, full of energy and very interesting.

                <h4>Adaptability</h4>
                <p>I have always been able to adjust to new environments and situations with ease, whether it's
                    mastering a new game or facing unexpected challenges. This flexibility allows me to thrive in
                    diverse settings and handle changes with a positive attitude.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item item4">
                <h4>Empathy</h4>
                <p>I am attuned to the feelings and needs of others, making it easy for me to connect and build strong
                    relationships. This sensitivity helps me support friends and family, providing understanding and
                    compassion when they need it most.</p>

                <p>In this activity, we were tasked with creating an HTML file that utilizes form and table elements.
                    For the first Pokémon, we were instructed to use a personal picture and specify a type. Then, we
                    needed to choose nine additional Pokémon and display their data accordingly.</p>

                    format posted by the FEU Tech Facebook account. The announcement needed to have a background image,
                    which could either be contained or cover based on our needs.</p>

                <p>For this task, we create six Pokemon cards using HTML and CSS. The cards were structured within a
                    container, with each row displaying three cards. Each Pokemon card included a brief description of
                    the Pokémon, and at the bottom, there were two buttons styled with a hover. </p>

                <p>We construct a custom-designed webpage using CSS Grid and Flexbox. We chose characters from anime or
                    video games to showcase our work. Some of these characters were displayed horizontally, while others
                    were shown in portrait mode. Each character was accompanied with descriptive text.</p>

                    dedicated to our favorite game, anime, TV show, or movie. Our webpage featured images and real text,
                    designed responsively with at least two breakpoints of our preference.</p>

                    proved to be one of the most difficult but satisfying aspects of our program. I invested a
                    significant amount of time and effort making sure everything was working properly.</p>
